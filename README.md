The **ReadAdvisor** chatbot is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to provide personalized book **recommendations** across various domains, such as science, history, philosophy, literature, and more. Built with advanced natural language processing **(NLP)** techniques, the chatbot processes user queries to suggest relevant books, offering additional insights like summaries, reviews, and **user feedback** to help users make informed decisions before making a purchase.

The core of the chatbot is powered by a neural network model trained on a dataset of book-related intents. This model uses a multi-layer neural network architecture, leveraging Dense layers for pattern recognition, Dropout layers to prevent overfitting, and a **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** optimizer to ensure efficient learning. The model is trained using tokenized, lemmatized input data to understand a wide variety of user queries and classify them into appropriate categories.
